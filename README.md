# Local-Minecraft-Server
Python script to start Minecraft server.

## Instructions
Download and add all three files within your Minecraft server folder. Run the [start-server.py](https://github.com/BauerJustin/Local-Minecraft-Server/blob/master/start-server.py) file to start the server. The external and local IP addresses will be displayed which you can give to other players so they can join. The text file will save the IP addresses and the Python script will notify you if any of the IP addresses have changed.
